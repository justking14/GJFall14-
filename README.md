This is a project I made in about ten hours for the Ludum Dare 31 Compo with the theme of Entire Game on One Screen

The controls are incredibly simple.  Press the right arrow to jump right and press the left arrow to jump left.
The tricky part is that the keys control not just a single character, but 9 seperate players.
Each player needs to find their way to the their own golden cube to beat the game.
Obviously, you could easily just focus on one player at a time, but that will take a while.
The point of the game is to beat it as quickly as possible.
My best time was about 158 seconds.
